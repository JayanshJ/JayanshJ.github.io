## 🧪 Formatting Assistant Test

This file demonstrates the formatting assistant functionality implemented in your ChatGPT app.

### What the Formatting Assistant Does

The formatting assistant automatically applies the following rules to AI responses:

**✨ Formatting Rules Applied:**

1. **Heading Separation** - Ensures headings are properly separated from body text
2. **List Formatting** - Normalizes bullet points and numbered lists
3. **Line Breaks** - Adds appropriate spacing between sections
4. **Emoji Enhancement** - Adds subtle emojis to common section types
5. **Code Block Spacing** - Ensures proper spacing around code
6. **Consistent Markdown** - Fixes formatting inconsistencies

#### Enhanced Styling

### 🔄 How It Works

The formatting assistant works by:

1. **Intercepting AI responses** before they're displayed
2. **Applying formatting rules** using the `formatAIResponse()` function
3. **Processing through markdown** with enhanced styling
4. **Displaying clean, readable content** to users

### ⚠️ Important Notes
